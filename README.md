 Master links

Things to do:
1. Build Links list
2. Build Layout
3. Ask new players what would be beneficial to them.
4. UI Guides
5. Random good information that would be good for new players to know. I.E. not queuing for old EX trials.
6. Information on Add ons like ffxiv quick login and DPS meters.
7. Expansion information page.
